                 Video Resolution Negotiation Using SDP
        draft-nandakumar-mmusic-video-resolution-negotiation-00

Abstract

   With the rise in realtime communication applications supporting
   video, there is a need for receivers of the video to setup
   appropriate expectations on their receive capacity for handling
   various video resolutions.  Negotiating maximum video receive
   resolution by an end-point is important to ensure a successful
   multimedia session that the end-point can decode and eventually
   render the received video stream.  This document proposes SDP
   [RFC4566] based Offer/Answer mechanism [RFC3264] to negotiate the
   maximum video width and height (video resolution) that an EndPoint is
   capable of receiving.

Internet-Draft        Video Resolution Negotiation         November 2013


1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


2.  Introduction

   Offlate, multimedia sessions are increasingly supporting video by
   default.  This is further fueled with the advent of technology
   standards such as RTCWeb, CLUE.  In order to successfully decode the
   incoming video stream, the decoder at the EndPoint must be capable of
   handling the recieved video resolution, amongst other things.  This
   document defines a new media-level SDP [RFC4566] attribute to setup
   maximum receive video resolution and [RFC3264] Offer/Answer
   procedures for successfully negotiating the same.


3.  Specification of the 'videoattr' SDP syntax

   This section defines the SDP video attribute which can be used in an
   SDP Offer/Answer exchange to indicate various maximum recieve video
   image resolution supported by an EndPoint.

3.1.  Attribute Syntax

   In this section, the syntax of the 'videoattr' attribute is
   described.  The 'videoattr' attribute is a media-level attribute.
   The section is split up in two parts: the first gives an overall view
   of the syntax, and the second describes how the syntax is used.

3.1.1.  Overall View of Syntax

       video-attr = "videoattr:" PT 1*2(1*WSP max-resolution)
       PT = 1*DIGIT / "*"
       max-resolition = "[" "x=" xyrange "," "y=" xyrange  "]"
                  ; x is the max horizontal image size range (pixel count)
                  ; y is the max vertical image size range (pixel count)

3.2.  Offer/Answer Rules

   An EndPoint supporting this mechanism indicates the maximum
   horizontal and vertical image size ranges that it is capable of
   handling while decoding and rendering the recieved video stream.
   This mechanism also implies that the reciever is capable of decoding
   video resolutions lower than the negotiated maximum resolution.

Internet-Draft        Video Resolution Negotiation         November 2013


   In the [RFC3264] usage, an SDP Answerer MUST NOT include the
   'videoattr' attribute in the SDP Answer unless the attribute is
   specified in the associated SDP Offer.

   If the SDP Answerer is not capable of sending any resolution lesser
   than or equal to Offered resolution, it MUST NOT include the
   'videoattr' attribute in the SDP Answer.


4.  SDP Examples

   The example SDP below shows an Offer that is capable of receiving
   upto [720,576] video resolution for the VP8 codec with Payload Type
   96.

   m=video 62537 RTP/SAVPF 96
   a=rtpmap:96 VP8/90000
   a=videoattr:96 [x=720, y=576]
   a=sendrecv

                                 Figure 1

   The example SDP below shows an Answer to the above SDP which is
   capable of receiving only upto [640,480] video image resolution.

   m=video 62537 RTP/SAVPF 96
   a=rtpmap:96 VP8/90000
   a=videoattr:96 [x=640, y=480]
   a=sendrecv
