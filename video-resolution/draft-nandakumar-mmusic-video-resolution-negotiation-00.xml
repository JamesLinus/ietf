    <abstract>
		<t>
       With the rise in realtime communication applications supporting video,
       there is a need for receivers of the video to setup  appropriate
       expectations on their receive capacity for handling various video
       resolutions. Negotiating maximum video receive resolution by an end-point
       is important to ensure a successful multimedia session that the end-point
       can decode and eventually render the received video stream.
       This document proposes SDP <xref target="RFC4566"/> based
       Offer/Answer mechanism <xref target="RFC3264"/>
       to negotiate the maximum video width and height (video resolution) that
       an EndPoint is capable of receiving.

    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
      <t>
        Offlate, multimedia sessions are increasingly supporting video by default.
        This is further fueled with the advent of technology standards such as RTCWeb,
        CLUE. In order to successfully decode the incoming video stream, the decoder
        at the EndPoint must be capable of handling the recieved video resolution,
        amongst other things. This document defines a new media-level
        SDP <xref target="RFC4566"/> attribute to setup maximum receive video resolution
        and <xref target="RFC3264"/> Offer/Answer procedures for successfully
        negotiating the same.

    <section title="Specification of the 'videoattr' SDP syntax " toc="default">
      <t>
       This section defines the SDP video attribute which can
       be used in an SDP Offer/Answer exchange to indicate
       various maximum recieve video image resolution supported by an
       EndPoint.
      </t>
      <section title="Attribute Syntax" toc="default">
        <t>
         In this section, the syntax of the 'videoattr' attribute is
         described.  The 'videoattr' attribute is a media-level attribute.
         The section is split up in two parts: the first gives an overall view
         of the syntax, and the second describes how the syntax is used.
        </t>
        <section title="Overall View of Syntax" toc="default">
        The syntax for the image attribute is in ABNF [RFC5234]:

       video-attr = "videoattr:" PT 1*2(1*WSP max-resolution)
       PT = 1*DIGIT / "*"
       max-resolition = "[" "x=" xyrange "," "y=" xyrange  "]"
                  ; x is the max horizontal image size range (pixel count)
                  ; y is the max vertical image size range (pixel count)

         <section title="Offer/Answer Rules" toc="default">
          <t>
             An EndPoint supporting this mechanism indicates the maximum
             horizontal and vertical image size ranges that it is capable
             of handling while decoding and rendering the recieved
             video stream. This mechanism also implies that the reciever
             is capable of decoding video resolutions lower than the
             negotiated maximum resolution.
          </t>
          <t>
            In the <xref target="RFC3264"/> usage, an SDP Answerer MUST NOT include
            the 'videoattr' attribute in the SDP Answer unless the attribute is specified
            in the associated SDP Offer.
          </t>
          <t>
            If the SDP Answerer is not capable of sending any resolution lesser than or
            equal to Offered resolution, it MUST NOT include the 'videoattr' attribute in
            the SDP Answer.

          The example SDP below shows an Offer that is capable of receiving upto
