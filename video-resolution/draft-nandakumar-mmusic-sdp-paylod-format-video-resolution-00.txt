  Payload specific parameters for negotiating video resolution in SDP.
     draft-nandakumar-mmusic-sdp-payload-format-video-resolution-00

Abstract

   With the rise in realtime communication applications supporting
   video, there is a need for receivers of the video to setup
   appropriate expectations on their receive capacity for handling
   various video image resolutions.  Negotiating maximum supported image
   resolution that could be handled by an Endpoint is important to
   successfully decode and render the received video streams.  This
   document proposes SDP [RFC4566] based Offer/Answer mechanism
   [RFC3264] to negotiate the maximum image width and height format
   specific SDP parameters supported by an Endpoint.

Internet-Draft        Video Resolution Negotiation         November 2013


1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


2.  Introduction

   Off late, multimedia communication sessions are increasingly
   supporting video by default.  This is further fueled with the advent
   of IETF technology standards such as RTCWeb, CLUE.  In order to
   successfully decode an incoming video stream, the decoder at the
   Endpoint must be capable of handling the image resolution of the
   received video streams, amongst other things.  This document extends
   SDP [RFC4566] media payload format specific parameters (a=fmtp) to
   setup a upper limit on the receiver's capability in successfully
   handling various image resolutions of the incoming video streams.  It
   also describes [RFC3264] Offer/Answer procedures for the same.


3.  Payload Format Parameters

   The optional media subtype parameters max-recv-width and max-recv-
   height specified below MAY be used to signal the capabilities of a
   receiver implementation.  These parameters MUST NOT be used for any
   other purposes.

3.1.  Media Type Registration

   New Optional Parameters
   1.  max-recv-width: The value of max-recv-width is an integer
       indicating maximum horizontal image range in pixels.  When max-
       recv-width is signaled, the receiver MUST be able to decode any
       horizontal image resolutions up to the signaled value.
   2.  max-recv-height: The value of max-recv-height is an integer
       indicating maximum vertical image range in pixels.  When max-
       recv-height is signaled, the receiver MUST be able to decode any
       vertical image resolutions up to the signaled value.


4.  SDP Parameters

4.1.  Mapping of optional parameters to SDP

   The optional parameters max-recv-width, max-recv-height when present,
   MUST be included in the "a=fmtp" line of SDP.  These parameters are
   expressed as a media type string, in the form of a semicolon

   separated list of parameter=value pairs.

   When signaled, both the attributes MUST be included and they signal
   the capabilities of a media receiver's implementation.  These
   parameters are implicitly downgradable from the media sender's
   perspective, i.e, they express the upper limit for a media sender's
   possible behavior.  Thus a media sender MAY select to set its encoder
   using only lower/lesser or equal values of these parameters.

4.2.  Usage with SDP offer/answer

   The interpretation of the optional parameters max-recv-width and max-
   recv-height depends on the direction attribute.  When the direction
   is sendrecv or recvonly, the value of this parameter indicates the
   ranges of horizontal and vertical image resolutions the media
   receiver is capable of rendering successfully.  When the direction is
   sendonly, these attributes have no interpretation and MUST be ignored
   by the receiving Endpoint, if present.

   If the media sender is not capable of sending any resolution lower
   than or equal to the values requested by the media receiver either in
   the SDP Offer or in the SDP Answer, the Offer/Answer procedure is
   considered as failure.

   An SDP Answerer MUST NOT include these parameters in the SDP Answer
   unless they are specified in the associated SDP Offer.

   If the SDP Answer doesn't contain these parameters, the Offerer MUST
   follow the procedures in the same way as if these parameters were
   never sent in the first place.  This might happen if the Answerer
   doesn't support/understand these parameters.


5.  SDP Examples

5.1.  Successful Scenario

   The example SDP below shows an Offer from an Endpoint that is capable
   of receiving up to [720,576] video image resolution for the VP8 codec
   with Payload Type 96.

   m=video 62537 RTP/SAVPF 96
   a=rtpmap:96 VP8/90000
   a=fmtp:96 max-fr=30;max-recv-width=720;max-recv-heigth=576
   a=sendrecv

   The example SDP below shows an Answer to the above SDP from an
   Endpoint that is capable of sending video streams with image
   resolutions lower than or equal to [720,576] and which is capable of
   receiving only up to [640,480] video image resolutions.

   m=video 62537 RTP/SAVPF 96
   a=rtpmap:96 VP8/90000
   a=fmtp:96 max-fr=30;max-recv-width=640;max-recv-heigth=480
   a=sendrecv

                                 Figure 1

5.2.  Failure Scenario

   The example SDP below shows an Offer from an Endpoint that is capable
   of receiving up to [720,576] video image resolution for the H.264
   codec with Payload Type 100.

m=video 62537 RTP/SAVPF 100
a=rtpmap:100 H264/90000
a=fmtp:100
  profile-level-id=42800d;max-mbps=40500;max-recv-width=720;max-recv-height=576
a=sendrecv

                                 Figure 1

   The example SDP below shows the Answer rejecting the above SDP Offer,
   since the receiver is unable to support the Offerer's requested image
   resolutions.

   m=video 0 RTP/SAVPF 100
   a=rtpmap:100 H264/90000
