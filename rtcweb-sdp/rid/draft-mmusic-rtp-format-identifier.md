--- abstract

In this specification, we define a framework for configuring and enumerating
RTP streams in the Session Description Protocol. This framework uses "rid"
SDP attribute to effectively extend RTP PT space, define media format
specification in a codec agnostic way and provide a way to unambiguously
map RTP Streams to a media description ("m=" line) in a given RTP Session in
the cases where such a mapping might not be possible.

Note: The name 'rid' is not yet finalalied. Please refer to "Open Issues" for
more details on the naming.

# Introduction

Recent developments in the field Real-time applications has forced

Payload Type (PT) in RTP provides mapping between the format of the RTP payload to the media format description specified in the signaling. For applications that use SDP for signaling, the constructs rtpmap/fmtp describe the characteristics for the media that is carried as RTP payload mapped to
a given PT.

Recents advances in standards such as RTCWeb, Netvc has given rise to
rich multimedia applications requiring support for multiple RTP Streams in a given session [[BUNDLE, Simulcast]] or having to support multiple codecs, for 
example. These demands have unearthed challenges inherent with the 

* Restricted RTP PT space in specifying the various payoad configurtions,

* Codec specific constructs for the payload formats in SDP,

* Ambiguity in mapping  between the RTP payload format and the equivalent signaling constructs in SDP,for example.

This specification defines a new SDP framework for configuring and enumerating 
RTP Streams called "RTP Stream Format Identifier (rid)" along with the SDP attributes to configure the individual RTP Streams in a codec agnostic way. This specification also proposes a new RTP header extension and SDES item to provide correlation to associate RTP packet to the payload format specification in the SDP.


# Key Words for Requirements

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFCXXXX

# Terminology
The terms Encoded Stream, Endpoint, Media Source, RTP Session, and
RTP Stream are used as defined in [I-D.ietf-avtext-rtp-grouping-taxonomy].

[RFC4566] and [RFC3264] terminology are used. 

# Motivation
  TODO

# Applicabilty Statement

The mechanism in this specification only applies to the Session Description Protocol (SDP) [RFC4566], when used together with the SDP offer/answer mechanism [RFC3264]. Declarative usage of SDP is out of scope of this document, and is thus undefined.

# SDP 'rid' Media Level Attribute

The section defines new SDP media-level attribute [RFC4566], 'rid'.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Name: rid

Value: 

Usage Level: media

Charset Dependent: no

Example:
a=rid:<rid-identifier> pt=<fmt-list> <rid-attribute>:<value> ... 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 'rid' SDP media attribute describes payload media format 
(defined via rid-level attributes SectionXXX) for one or more 
Payload Types. 'rid-identifier' identifies the RTP Stream to which 
the payload configuration corresponding to the 'rid-level' attributes 
applies.

The 'rid' media attribute MAY be used for any RTP-based media transport. It
is not defined for other transports.

A given 'rid-identfier' MUST be unique across all the media 
descriptions. Also, the combination of RTP PT (a.k.a fmt in SDP) and 
a 'rid' MUST be unique across all the media descriptions as well.

Though the 'rid-level' attributes specified by the 'rid' property
follow the same syntax as session-level and media-level attributes,
they are defined independently.  All 'rid-level' attributes MUST be
registered with IANA, using the registry defined in Section XXXX

Section XXXX gives a formal Augmented Backus-Naur Form(ABNF) 
[RFC5234] grammar for the "rid" attribute.


# "rid-level' attributes

This section defines specific 'rid-level' attributes that can be used 
to describe individua RTP Streams in a codec-agnostic way.

All the attributes are optional and are subjected to negotiation 
based on the Offer/Answer rules described in Section XXXX.

Section XXXX provides formal Augmented Backus-Naur Form(ABNF) [RFC5234] grammar for each of the "rid-level" attributes defined in this section.


## The "max-width", "max-recv-width", "max-send-width" Attributes

This set of paramters specificy maximum width in pixels for spatial 
resolution. 'max-recv-width' and 'max-send-width' provides granular
control for setting the video width for send and receive directions 
respectively. 'max-width' MUST be used when asymmetrical resolution
setting per direction is not required.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

a=rid:<rid-identifier> pt=<fmt-list> max-send-width=<send-width-val> \
max-recv-width=<recv-width-val> ...

(OR)

a=rid:<rid-identifier> pt=<fmt-list> max-width=<width-val> ...

Example:
1) Asymmetric video width resolution in pixels
a=rid:1 pt=96 max-send-width=1280 max-recv-width=320

2) Symmetric video width resolution in pixels
a=rid:1 PT=96 max-width=1280 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


## The "max-height", "max-recv-height", "max-send-height" Attributes

This set of paramters specificy maximum height in pixels for spatial 
resolution. 'max-recv-height' and 'max-send-height' provides granular
control for setting the video width for send and receive directions 
respectively. 'max-height' MUST be used when asymmetrical resolution
setting per direction is not required.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

a=rid:<rid-identifier> pt=<fmt-list> max-send-height=<send-height-val> \
max-recv-height=<recv-height-val> ...

(OR)

a=rid:<rid-identifier> pt=<fmt-list> max-height=<height-val> ...

Example:
1) Asymmetric video width resolution in pixels
a=rid:1 pt=96 max-send-height=720 max-recv-height=180

2) Symmetric video height resolution in pixels
a=rid:1 PT=96 max-height=720
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


## The "max-fps", "max-recv-fps", "max-send-fps" Attributes

This set of paramters specificy maximum video framerate in frames
per second. 'max-recv-fps' and 'max-send-fps' provides granular
control for setting the video framerate for send and receive directions 
respectively. 'max-fps' MUST be used when asymmetrical framerate
setting per direction is not required.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

a=rid:<rid-identifier> pt=<fmt-list> max-send-fps=<send-fps-val> \
max-recv-fps=<recv-fps-val> ...

(OR)

a=rid:<rid-identifier> pt=<fmt-list> max-fps=<v-val> ...

Example:
1) Asymmetric video framerate resolution in pixels
a=rid:1 pt=96 max-send-width=60 max-recv-width=30

2) Symmetric video framerate resolution in pixels
a=rid:1 PT=96 max-fps=30
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



## The "max-fs", "max-recv-fs", "max-send-fs" Attributes

This set of paramters specificy maximum video framesize in pixels
per frame. 'max-recv-fs' and 'max-send-fs' provides granular
control for setting the video framesize for send and receive directions 
respectively. 'max-fs' MUST be used when asymmetrical framesize
setting per direction is not required.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

a=rid:<rid-identifier> pt=<fmt-list> max-send-fs=<send-fs-val> \
max-recv-fs=<recv-fs-val> ...

(OR)

a=rid:<rid-identifier> pt=<fmt-list> max-fs=<fs-val> ...

Examples
1) Asymmetric video framesize
a=rid:1 pt=96 max-send-fs=1382400 max-recv-fs=57600

2) Symmetric video framesize
a=rid:1 PT=96 max-fs=1382400
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


## The "max-br", "max-recv-br", "max-send-br" Attributes

This set of paramters specificy maximum video bitrate in bits
per second. 'max-recv-br' and 'max-send-br' provides granular
control for setting the video bitrate for send and receive directions 
respectively. 'max-br' MUST be used when asymmetrical video bitrate
setting per direction is not required.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

a=rid:<rid-identifier> pt=<fmt-list> max-send-br=<send-br-val> \
max-recv-width=<recv-br-val> ...

(OR)

a=rid:<rid-identifier> pt=<fmt-list> max-br=<br-val> ...

Example:
1) Asymmetric video bitrate
a=rid:1 pt=96 max-br-width=2000000 max-recv-width=1000000

2) Symmetric video bitrate
a=rid:1 PT=96 max-br=2000000
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


## The "max-pps", "max-recv-pps", "max-send-pps" Attributes

This set of paramters specificy maximum video pixelrate in pixels
per second. 'max-recv-pps' and 'max-send-pps' provides granular
control for setting the video pixelrate for send and receive directions 
respectively. 'max-pps' MUST be used when asymmetrical video pixelrate
setting per direction is not required.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

a=rid:<rid-identifier> pt=<fmt-list> max-send-pps=<send-pps-val> \
max-recv-width=<recv-pps-val> ...

(OR)

a=rid:<rid-identifier> pt=<fmt-list> max-pps=<pps-val> ...

Example:
1) Asymmetric video pixelrate
a=rid:1 pt=96 max-pps-width=1280 max-pps-width=320

2) Symmetric video pixelrate
a=rid:1 PT=96 max-pps=1280 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


## The "depend‚Äù attribute

The 'depend' attribute can be used to establish relationship
between 'rid-identifiers'. Such relationship exists when
signaling layer dependencies for Scalable Video Coding (SVC) or
relating a primary RTP Stream with a Secondary RTP Stream (FEC/RTX),
for example

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

a=rid:<rid-identifier> pt=<fmt-list> depend=<rid-identifier>, ...

Example to show rid '2' depending on '1'
a=rid:1 pt=100
a=rid:2 pt=101 depend=1

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The list of 'rid-identifiers' as part of the depend attribute MUST 
be defined elsewhere in the SDP. If not, such definition MUST be 
considered as error and the entire 'rid' line MUST be rejected.

# SDP Examples


## Two simulcast streams with PT reuse

This example shows and offer answer exchange where the offer propose to sendonly of two simulcast streams at 720P30 and 180P15. The answer accepts both of them.


# Formal Grammar

This section gives a formal Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF)
[RFC5234] grammar for each of the new media and rid-level attributes
defined in this document.

# RTP 'rid' Header Extension

The payload, containing the identification-tag, of the RTP 'rid' header extension element can be encoded using either the one-byte or two-byte header [RFC5285]. The identification-tag payload is UTF-8 encoded, as in SDP.

Note, that set of header extensions included in the packet needs to be padded to the next 32-bit boundary using zero bytes [RFC5285].

It is recommended that the identification-tag is kept short. Due to the properties of the RTP header extension mechanism, when using the one-byte header, a tag that is 1-3 bytes will result in that a minimal number of 32-bit words are used for the RTP header extension, in case no other header extensions are included at the same time. 

# Open Issues

## Name of the idetifier
The name 'rid' has not yet been finalized and the authors believe taking
help from the list would be a right approach for deciding the name.

Here are the few options that were considered while writing this draft

* ESID: Encoded Stream ID, does not align well with taxonomy which defines Encoded Stream as before RTP packetization.

* RSID or RID: RTP Stream ID, aligns better with taxonomy but very vague.

* LID: Layer ID, aligns well for SVC with each layer in a separate stream, but not for other SVC layerings or independent simulcast which is awkward to view as layers.

* EPT or XPT: EXtended Payload Type, conveys XPT.PT usage well, but may be confused with PT, for example people may mistakenly think they can use it in other places where PT would normally be used. 

# IANA Considerations

## New RTP Header Extension URI
This document defines a new extension URI in the RTP Compact Header Extensions subregistry of the Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP) Parameters registry, according to the following data:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Extension URI: urn:ietf:params:rtp-hdrext:rid
    Description:   RTP Stream Format Identifier
    Contact:       <name@email.com>
    Reference:     RFCXXXX

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


## New SDP Media-Level attribute

This document defines "rid" as SDP media-level attribute.
    This attribute must be registered by IANA under
    "Session Description Protocol (SDP) Parameters" under "att-field
   (media level only)".

The "rid" attribute is used to identify characteristics of RTP stream
   with in a RTP Session. Its format is defined in Section XXXX.

## Registry for RID-Level Attributes

   This specification creates a new IANA registry named "att-field
   (rid level)" within the SDP parameters registry.  rid-level
   attributes MUST be registered with IANA and documented under the same
   rules as for SDP session-level and media-level attributes as
   specified in [RFC4566].

   New attribute registrations are accepted according to the
   "Specification Required" policy of [RFC5226], provided that the
   specification includes the following information:

   o  contact name, email address, and telephone number

   o  attribute name (as it will appear in SDP)

   o  long-form attribute name in English

   o  whether the attribute value is subject to the charset attribute

   o  a one-paragraph explanation of the purpose of the attribute

   o  a specification of appropriate attribute values for this attribute

   The initial set of rid-level attribute names, with definitions in
   Section XXXX of this document, is given below
