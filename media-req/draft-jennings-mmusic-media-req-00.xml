    <abstract>
      <t>This document outlines some of the requirements driving

      needs of WebRTC, CLUE, and other working groups. </t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t> For the past several meetings, there has been discusion
      around varios mechanism to reduce the number of UDP ports needed
      by applications for RTP. This document attempts to capture some
      of the requirements that are important in selecting the solution
      for how to represent the SDP to negotiate the RTP media that is
      using reduced ports.
      </t>
    </section>


    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
      "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
      document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
      target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>. This document generically uses RTP to mean RTP and SRTP.  </t>
    </section>


    <section title="Requirements">
      <t>This section covers the requirements from varios WG for
      setting up up media. Obviously it does not try and cover all the
      requirements but it tries to cover a set that seem relevant to
      decisions around multiplexing onto few UDP ports. </t>

      <t>High Priority Requirements:<list style="numbers">
          
	<t>Lots of media flows, but only a few UDP transports flows
	</t>

	<t>Supports existing and future SIP devices with a single
	offer/answer </t>
     </list></t>
 
   <t>Other Requirements:<list style="numbers">
   
	<t>Add/remove one way video flows with minimal chance of glare
	for RTCWeb applications that know they are working with
	another side that support this capability </t>

	<t>Negotiation when both ends have different capabilities </t>

	<t>No knowledge of capabilities of the other side before
	generating the SDP offer </t>

	<t>Need uniform way to deal with new SDP parameters </t>

	<t>Get to small number of UPD transport flow within one
	signaling roundtrip in cases where both sides implement all
	the WebRTC requirement </t>

	<t>Can set parameters such as resolution, and perhaps
	bandwidth, for each RTCWeb Track </t>

	<t>Be able to identify the RTCWeb tracks concept with a stable
	ID </t>

	<t>Allow different sources (cameras) to use different codecs
	</t>

      </list></t>
    </section>
 

   <section title="Non-Requirements">
      <t> Some items are not a major goal. If methods are found that
      work for these as well, that is great, but they are not a
      priority item. </t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          
	<t>Support of non RTP media</t>

	<t> Working with SIP proxies or B2BUA that are not compliant
	with the standards. The reason for this is it is just not
	possible to design for every possible thing that does not do
	what the standards require. </t>

      </list></t>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This document makes no request of IANA.</t>
    </section>


    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>These requirements have no additional security considerations
      other than those captured in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch"></xref>.</t>
