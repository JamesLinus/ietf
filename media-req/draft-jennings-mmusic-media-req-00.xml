    <abstract>
      <t>This document outlines some of the requirements driving
      various consideration in the MMUSIC working group to meet the
      needs of WebRTC, CLUE, and other working groups. </t>

      discussion of solutions and is not intended to become an RFC. </t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t> For the past several meetings, there has been discussions
      around various mechanism to reduce the number of UDP ports needed
      by applications for RTP. This document attempts to capture some
      of the requirements that are important in selecting the solution
      for how to represent the SDP to negotiate the RTP media that is
      using reduced ports.
      </t>
    </section>


    <section title="Terminology">
      <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described
      in <xref target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>. This document
      generically uses RTP to mean RTP and SRTP.  </t>
    </section>


    <section title="Requirements">
      <t>This section covers the requirements from various WG for
      setting up up media. Obviously it does not try and cover all the
      requirements but it tries to cover a set that seem relevant to
      decisions around multiplexing onto few UDP ports. </t>

      <t>High Priority Requirements:<list style="numbers">
          
	<t> Support lots of media flows, but use only a few UDP
	transports flows. For example support audio and multiple
	cameras using only one or two UDP ports.
	</t>

	<t>Supports existing and future SIP devices with a single
	offer/answer exchange. </t>
     </list></t>
 
   <t>Other Requirements:<list style="numbers">
   
	<t>Need a uniform way to deal with new SDP parameters. </t>

	<t>Add/remove one way video flows with minimal chance of glare
	for RTCWeb applications that know they are working with
	another side that support this capability. </t>

	<t>Negotiation when both ends have different capabilities. </t>

	<t>No knowledge of capabilities of the other side before
	generating the SDP offer. </t>

	<t>Can reduce down to a small number of UDP transport flow within one
	offer/answer signaling roundtrip in cases where both sides implement all
	the WebRTC requirement. </t>

	<t>Can set parameters such as resolution, and perhaps
	bandwidth, independently for each RTCWeb Track. </t>

	<t>Be able to identify the RTCWeb tracks with an identifier
	that is stable over the duration of the session. More
	information can be found in <xref
	target="I-D.alvestrand-mmusic-msid" />. </t>

	<t>Allow different sources (E.g. cameras) to use different
	codecs. For example, if one camera had hardware encoders for
	VP8 while another had encoders for H.264, the device may wish
	to negotiate different codecs. </t>

      </list></t>
    </section>
 

   <section title="Non-Requirements">
      <t> Some items are not a major goal. If methods are found that
      work for these as well, that is great, but they are not a
      priority item. </t>

      <t><list style="numbers">
          
	<t>Support of non RTP media</t>

	<t> Working with SIP proxies or B2BUA that are not compliant
	with the standards. The reason for this is it is just not
	possible to design for every possible thing that does not do
	what the standards require. </t>

      </list></t>
    </section>


    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This document makes no request of IANA.</t>
    </section>


    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>These requirements have no additional security considerations
      other than those captured in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-rtcweb-security-arch"></xref>.</t>

<abstract><t>This document specifies a grouping mechanism for RTP media streams that can be used to specify relations between media streams within different RTP sessions as well as within a single RTP session.  This mechanism is used to signal the association between the RTP concept of SSRC and the WebRTC concept of "media stream" / "media stream track" using SDP signaling.  This document is an input document for discussion.  It should be discussed in the MMUSIC WG list, mmusic@ietf.org.</t></abstract>
