Introduction   This document specifies the syntax and semantics of the Uniform   Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for the Traversal Using Relays   around NAT (TURN) protocol.   The TURN protocol is a specification allowing hosts behind NAT to   control the operation of a relay server.  The relay server allows   hosts to exchange packets with its peers.  The peers themselves may   also be behind NATs.  RFC 5766 [RFC5766] defines the specifics of the   TURN protocol.   The 'turn/turns' URI scheme is used to designate a TURN server (also   known as a relay) on Internet hosts accessible using the TURN   protocol.  Such an URI scheme allows a uniform way to describe,   configure and exchange the information identifying a TURN server.   This would prevent the shortcomings inherent with encoding similar   information in non-uniform syntaxes such as the ones proposed in   WEBRTC Standards [WEBRTC], for example.   The 'turn/turns' URI adheres to syntax as defined in RFC 3986   [RFC3986].2.  Terminology   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].3.  URI Scheme Definition3.1.  URI Scheme Syntax   The 'turn' URI takes the following form (the syntax below is non-   normative):      turn:<userinfo>@<host>:<port>      turns:<userinfo>@<host>:<port>   Where <userinfo> with the "@" (at) sign character, as well as the   <port> part and the preceding ":" (colon) character, is OPTIONAL.   The normative syntax of the 'turn' URI is defined as shown in the   following Augmented Backus-Naur Form (ABNF) [RFC5234] rule:Nandakumar, et al.

URI Scheme Semantics   The TURN protocol supports sending messages over UDP, TCP or TLS-   over-TCP.  The 'turns' URI scheme SHALL be used when TURN is run over   TLS-over-TCP and the 'turn' scheme SHALL be used otherwise.  The   <host> part of the 'turn' URI, which is REQUIRED, denotes the TURN   server host.  The <userinfo> part, identifies the credential required   for the long-term credential mechanism as described in the section 4   of RFC 5766 [RFC5766].  The <port> part, if present, denotes the port   on which the TURN server is awaiting connection requests.  If it is   absent, the default port SHALL be 3478 for both UDP and TCP.  The   default port for TURN over TLS SHALL be 5349.   Example:      turns:username:password@example.com      This example configuration SHALL identify a long-term credential      for the TLS-over-TCP connection to TURN server, example.com, on      defualt port 5349.Nandakumar, et al.

IANA Considerations   This document instructs IANA to register the 'turn' and 'turns' URI   schemes in the "Permanent URI Schemes" sub-registry in the "Uniform   Resource Identifier (URI) Schemes" IANA registry [URIREG].  These   registrations follows the URI Scheme Registration Template detailed   in Section 5.4 of RFC 4395 [RFC4395].4.1.
