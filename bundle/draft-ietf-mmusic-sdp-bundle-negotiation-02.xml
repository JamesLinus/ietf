    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
		<t>
			In the IETF RTCWEB WG, a need to use a single 5-tuple for sending and receiving media 
			associated with multiple SDP media descriptions ("m=" lines) has been identified. This would e.g. allow the usage
			of a single set of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) <xref format="default" 
			pageno="false" target="RFC5245"/> candidates for multiple media descriptions. Normally 
			different media types (audio, video etc) will be described using different media 
			descriptions.			
		</t>		
		<t>
			This specification defines two new SDP Grouping Framework SDP grouping framework <xref 
			format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5888"/> extension, "BUNDLE" and "USE-BUNDLE", that can be
			used with the Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer mechanism <xref format="default" 
			pageno="false" target="RFC3264"/> to negotiate the usage of bundled media, which refers 
			to the usage of a single 5-tuple transport flow for media associated with multiple SDP media descriptions 
			("m=" lines). 
                        The BUNDLE is used in an SDP Offer to indicate the
                        Offerer supports and would like to use bundled media
                        while the USE-BUNDLE is used in an SDP Answer to
                        indicate that Answerer has agreed to use bundled media.
		</t>
		<t>
			When an endpoint generates an SDP Offer <xref format="default" pageno="false" 
			target="RFC3264"/>, which includes a "BUNDLE" group, 
                        the endpoint is indicating that it is willing to 
                        have each "m=" line associated with the 
			group end up using a single transport port if bundle is negotiated.
		</t>
		<t>
			When an endpoint generates an SDP Answer <xref format="default" pageno="false" 
			target="RFC3264"/>, which includes a "USE-BUNDLE" group, each "m=" line associated with the 
			group will end up using a single transport port.
		</t>
		<t>
			As defined in RFC 4566 <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC4566"/>, the 
			semantics of multiple "m=" lines using the same port number value are undefined, and 
			there is no grouping defined by such means. Instead, an explicit grouping mechanism needs 
			to be used to express the intended semantics. This specification provides such extension.
		</t>
		<t>
			When media is transported using the Real-Time Protocol (RTP) <xref format="default" 
			pageno="false" target="RFC3550"/>, the default assumption of the mechanism is that all 
			media associated with a "BUNDLE" group will form a single RTP Session <xref format="default" 
			pageno="false" target="RFC3550"/>. However, future specifications can extend the mechanism, 
			in order to negotiate RTP Session multiplexing, i.e. "BUNDLE" groups where media associated 
			with a group form multiple RTP Sessions.
		</t>
		<t>
			The mechanism is backward compatible. Entities that do not support the "BUNDLE" grouping 
			extension, or do not want to enable the mechanism for a given session, are expected to 
			generate a "normal" SDP Offer and Answer, using different port number values for each "m=" line, to 
			the SDP Offer.

    <section  title="Design Considerations" toc="default">

      <t> Note: There is not yet WG consensus on if the offer should have
      different ports in the "m=" lines or the same port. Previous version of
      this draft showed it as the same and this version shows it as different
      ports to illustrate the changes. </t>

      <t> There are three primary issues to consider when selecting if the "m="
      lines should have similar or different ports. They are 1) interoperability
      with existing UAs 2) interoperability with B2BUA that create offers for
      features they do not support; and 3) time to gather candidates when using
      ICE;. This section will explain these issues and impact on the
      design. </t>

      <section  title="UA Interoperability" toc="default">

      <t> Consider the following offer / answer exchange where Alice make an offer to Bob: </t>

     <t> RFC 4961 specifies a way of doing symmetric RTP but that is an a later
     invention to RTP and Bob can not assume that Alice supports RFC 4961. This
     means that Alice may be sending RTP from a different port than 10000 or
     10002 - some implementation simply send the RTP from an ephemeral
     port. When Bob's endpoint receives an RTP packet, the only way that Bob
     know if it should be passed to the video or audio codec is by looking at
     the port it was received on. This lead some SDP implementations to use the
     fact that each "m=" line had a different port number to use that port
     number as an index to find the correct m line in the SDP. As a result, some
     implementations that do support symmetric RTP and ICE still use a SDP data
     structure where SDP with "m=" lines with the same port such as:</t>

        <t> Some of the developers of products that do this make the argument
        that this is not a bug and that for SDP to work when not using thing
        like 4961, the port numbers need tobe unique thus it perfectly
        reasonable for their software to make this assumption. The authors are
        not suggesting this is a good way to design an SDP stack but merely
        trying to provide an explanation of why some UAs behave this way and why
        theses devices consider it acceptable. </t>

      <section  title="B2BUA Interoperability" toc="default">

        <t> Some back to back user agents may be configured in a mode where if
        the incoming call leg contains an SDP attribute the B2BUA does not
        understand, the B2BUS still generates that SDP attribute in the Offer
        for the outgoing call leg. Consider an B2BUA that did not understand
        "a=rtcp" attribute from RFC 3605 yet acted this way. Further assume that
        the B2BUA was configured to tear down any call where it did not see any
        RTCP for 5 minutes. In this cases, if the B2BUA received an Offer like: </t>

        <t> It would be looking for RTCP on port 49172 but would not see any
        because the RTCP would be on port 53020 and after five minutes, it would
        tear down the call. Similarly, an SBC that did not understand BUNDLE yet
        put BUNDLE in it's offer may be looking for media on the wrong port and
        tear down the call. It is worth noting that a B2BUA that generated an
        Offer with capabilities it does not understand is not compliant with the
        specifications. </t>

        <t> To mitigate the risk to B2BUAs that generate BUNDLE when they should
        not, the spec includes a feature where once the initial Offer / Anser is
        done and ICE is completed, a second Offer / Answer exchange is done with
        the all the "m=" lines and associated ICE transports set to the actual
        5-tuple in use. This allows any device on Offer / Answer path to be
        updated even if it does not understand BUNDLE. </t>

        <section  title="3GPP  Impact" toc="default">
          <t> It is very unlikely that the B2BUA issue will be a problem for
          3GPP deployments. If any B2BUA in the path of the call, either in home
          or roaming network, removes the "BUNDLE" group attribute from the
          offer, BUNDLE will not be negotiated and this will not be a
          problem. It is extremely unlikely that unknown headers would be
          allowed to flow all the way between the endpoints as that would allow
          users to tunnel arbitrary data over the headers and likely end up with
          fee data transport between the devices. Some element of the call
          signaling path will groom the signaling and remove unknown or un
          acceptable things such as this when they are coming from the end users
          equipment.  </t>

          <t> Even in cases where both endpoint support BUNDLE and the IMS
          B2BUAs implement this specification, there are cases where the IMS
          network will desire to remove BUNDLE because it makes it easier to
          provide different QoS to the media associated with different "m="
          lines. </t>
        </section>

      </section>

      <section  title="Candidate Gathering" toc="default">
        <t> When using ICE, an candidate needs to be gathered for each port. This
        takes approximately 20 ms extra for each extra "m=" line due to the NAT
        pacing requirements. All of this gather can be overlapped with other
        things while the page is loading to minimize the impact. If the client
        only wants to generate TURN or STUN ICE candidates for one of the "m="
        lines and then use trickle ICE [TODO REF] to get the non host ICE
        candidates for the rest of the "m=" lines, it MAY do that and will not
        need any additional gathering time.  </t>

        <t> Some people have suggested a TURN extension to get a bunch of TURN
        allocation at once. This would only provide a single STUN result so in
        cases where the other end did not support BUNDLE, may cause more use of
        the TURN server but would be quick in the cases where both sides
        supported BUNDLE and would fall back to a successful call in the other
        cases.  </t>
      </section>

      <section  title="Analysis" toc="default">
        <t> 
          This largely comes down to a question of breaking the UA or the
          B2BUA cases. The WG should consider things such as:
          <list style="numbers">

            <t> In places we imagine this being deployed, how common will
            breakage be? </t>

            <t> How much effort is it to fix that? </t>

            <t> What are our design principles for SDP that allow us to create
            and deploy new SDP extensions? </t>

            <t> When does the breakage happen. Will the call just fail or will
            the call get set up then later fail? </t>

          </list>
        </t>
        <t> The port numbers on the "m=" lines of the initial Offer can be the
        same or different. Deployments can be upgraded to make either way work so
        neither one is a complete show stopped but the WG needs to pick which
        one is the "least bad" and move forward.  </t>

		<section title="General" toc="default">
			<t>
				When entities negotiate the usage of bundled media, the default assumption 
				is that all media associated with the bundled media will form a single RTP 
				session.
			</t>
			<t>
				The usage of multiple RTP Sessions within a "BUNDLE" group is outside the scope
				of this specification. Other specification needs to extend the mechanism in
				order to allow negotiation of such bundle groups.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Single RTP Session" toc="default">
			<t>
				When a single RTP Session is used, media associated with all "m=" lines part 
				of a bundle group share a single SSRC <xref format="default" pageno="false" 
				target="RFC3550"/> numbering space.
			</t>			
			<t>
				In addition, the following rules and restrictions apply for a single RTP
				Session:
			</t>
			<t>
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>- The dynamic payload type values used in the "m=" lines MUST NOT overlap.</t>
					<t>- The "proto" value in each "m=" line MUST be identical (e.g. RTP/AVPF).</t>
					<t>- A given SSRC SHOULD NOT transmit RTP packets using payload types that 
					originates from different "m=" lines.</t>
				</list>				
			</t>		
			<t>
				NOTE: The last bullet above is to avoid sending multiple media types from the same SSRC. 
				If transmission of multiple media types are done with time overlap RTP and RTCP fails 
				to function. Even if done in proper sequence this causes RTP Timestamp rate switching 
				issues [ref to draft-ietf-avtext-multiple-clock-rates].

		<section anchor="sec-ice-can" title="Candidates" toc="default">
			<t>
				When an ICE-enabled SDP Offerer sends an initial SDP offer, it MUST include ICE candidates 
				for each "m=" line associated with a "BUNDLE" group. The candidate values MUST be
				different for each "m=" line associated with the group. This rule does not apply 
                                to subsequent SDP Offers, when the usage of bundled media has already been 
				negotiated.
			</t>
			<t>
				When an ICE-enabled SDP Answerer receives an SDP Offer, offering a "BUNDLE" group and 
				ICE, if the SDP Answerer enables ICE, it MUST include ICE candidates for each "m=" line of
				the SDP Answer. This also applies for "m=" lines that are part of a "USE-BUNDLE" group, in 
				which case the candidate values MUST be the same for each "m=" line associated with
				the group. This rule applies also to subsequent SDP Answers, when the usage 
				of bundled media has already been negotiated.
			</t>
			<t>
				Once the usage of bundled media has been negotiated, ICE connectivity checks and keep-alives 
				only needs to be performed for the 5-tuple used by the "USE-BUNDLE" group, 
                                instead of for each individual m= line 
				associated with the group.
