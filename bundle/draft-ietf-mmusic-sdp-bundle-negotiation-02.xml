    <section title="Introduction" toc="default">
		<t>
			In the IETF RTCWEB WG, a need to use a single 5-tuple for sending and receiving media 
			associated with multiple SDP media descriptions ("m=" lines) has been identified. This would e.g. allow the usage
			of a single set of Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) <xref format="default" 
			pageno="false" target="RFC5245"/> candidates for multiple media descriptions. Normally 
			different media types (audio, video etc) will be described using different media 
			descriptions.			
		</t>		
		<t>
			This specification defines two new SDP Grouping Framework SDP grouping framework <xref 
			format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC5888"/> extension, "BUNDLE" and "USE-BUNDLE", that can be
			used with the Session Description Protocol (SDP) Offer/Answer mechanism <xref format="default" 
			pageno="false" target="RFC3264"/> to negotiate the usage of bundled media, which refers 
			to the usage of a single 5-tuple transport flow for media associated with multiple SDP media descriptions 
			("m=" lines).
		</t>
		<t>
			When an endpoint generates an SDP Offer <xref format="default" pageno="false" 
			target="RFC3264"/>, which includes a "BUNDLE" group, 
                        the endpoint is indicating that it is willing to 
                        have each "m=" line associated with the 
			group end up using a single transport port if bundle is negotiated.
		</t>
		<t>
			When an endpoint generates an SDP Answer <xref format="default" pageno="false" 
			target="RFC3264"/>, which includes a "USE-BUNDLE" group, each "m=" line associated with the 
			group will end up using a single transport port.
		</t>
		<t>
			As defined in RFC 4566 <xref format="default" pageno="false" target="RFC4566"/>, the 
			semantics of multiple "m=" lines using the same port number value are undefined, and 
			there is no grouping defined by such means. Instead, an explicit grouping mechanism needs 
			to be used to express the intended semantics. This specification provides such extension.
		</t>
		<t>
			When media is transported using the Real-Time Protocol (RTP) <xref format="default" 
			pageno="false" target="RFC3550"/>, the default assumption of the mechanism is that all 
			media associated with a "BUNDLE" group will form a single RTP Session <xref format="default" 
			pageno="false" target="RFC3550"/>. However, future specifications can extend the mechanism, 
			in order to negotiate RTP Session multiplexing, i.e. "BUNDLE" groups where media associated 
			with a group form multiple RTP Sessions.
		</t>
		<t>
			The mechanism is backward compatible. Entities that do not support the "BUNDLE" grouping 
			extension, or do not want to enable the mechanism for a given session, are expected to 
			generate a "normal" SDP Offer and Answer, using different port number values for each "m=" line, to 
			the SDP Offer.
		</t>

	    <section title="Terminology" toc="default">
		<t>
			The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", 
			"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be 
			interpreted as described in RFC 2119  <xref target="RFC2119" pageno="false" 
			format="default"/>.
		</t>
		<t>
			5-tuple: A collection of the following values: source IP address, source transport port, 
			destination IP address, destination transport port and transport protocol.
		</t>
		<t>
			Bundled media: Two or more RTP streams using a single 5-tuple. The RTCP 
			streams associated with the RTP streams also use a single 5-tuple, which might
			be the same, but can also be different, as the one used by the RTP streams.

    <section title="Applicability Statement" toc="default">
		<t>
			The mechanism in this specification only applies to the Session Description Protocol (SDP)

	<section title="SDP Grouping Framework BUNDLE Extension Semantics" toc="default">
		<t>
			This section defines a new SDP Grouping Framework extension, "BUNDLE".
		</t>
		<t>
			The "BUNDLE" extension in an SDP Offer can be indicated using an SDP session-level 'group'
			attribute. Each SDP media description ("m=" line) that is grouped together, 
			using an SDP media-level 'mid' attribute, is part of a specific "BUNDLE" 
			group. 
		</t>
         </section>

	<section title="SDP Grouping Framework USE-BUNDLE Extension Semantics" toc="default">
		<t>
			This section defines a new SDP Grouping Framework extension, "USE-BUNDLE".
		</t>
		<t>
			The "USE-BUNDLE" extension in an SDP Answer can be indicated using an SDP session-level 'group'
			attribute. Each SDP media description ("m=" line) that is grouped together, 
			using an SDP media-level 'mid' attribute, is part of a specific "USE-BUNDLE" 
			group. The 5-tuple used is the one formed by the transport information from the
                        mid of the first entry in the BUNDLE group and the first entry of the USE-BUNDLE group.

		<section anchor="sec-oa-gen" title="General" toc="default">
			<t>
				When an SDP Offerer or SDP Answerer generates an SDP Offer or SDP Answer, 
				that describes bundled media, it MUST insert an SDP session-level 'group' 
				attribute, with a "BUNDLE" value for
                                Offers or a "USE-BUNDLE" for answers, and assign SDP media-level 'mid' attribute 
				values to each "m=" line associated with the group.
			</t>
			<t>
				In addition, the entity that generates the SDP Offer MUST also 
                                generate the rest of the offer in roughly the same ways as if it did not support BUNDLE. For 
				each "m=" line that is part of the "BUNDLE" group:
			</t>
			<t>
				<list style="numbers">
					<t>Use a different port number value.</t>
					<t>Use the same connection data ("c=" line) value.</t>
					<t>Use a different port for each SDP 'rtcp' attribute value, when 'rtcp' attribute is used.</t>
					<t>Use ICE candidate values with different ports and values, when ICE is used.</t>
					<t>Insert and support an SDP 'rtpc-mux' attribute.</t>
                                        <t>Use the same DTLS-SRTP fingerprint attribute, when DTLS-SRTP is used</t>
                                        <t>Use different SDES crypto attribute, when SDES is used</t>
				</list>				
			</t>
                        <t> There are also special rules for handling many
                        different attributes as defined in TODO
                        [draft-nandakumar-rtcweb-sdp-attribute-analysis]. It is
                        not possible to use bundle with some attributes. </t>

		<section title="SDP Offerer Procedures" toc="default">			
			<t>
				When an SDP Offerer creates an SDP Offer, that offers bundled media, it MUST 
				create the SDP Offer according to the procedures in <xref format="default" 
				pageno="false" target="sec-oa-gen"/>.
			</t>
			<t>
				If the associated SDP Answer contains an SDP session-level 'group' attribute,
				with a "USE-BUNDLE" value, 
				the SDP Offerer can start using the 5-tuple of the first "m=" line in the group 
                                for sending and receiving media for all the "m=" lines in the group.
			</t>
			<t>
				If the SDP Answer does not include a session-level SDP 'group' attribute, with a 
				"USE-BUNDLE" value, the SDP Offerer cannot use the same 5-tuple for media associated 
				with multiple "m=" lines.
			</t>
			<t>
				If the SDP Answer indicates that it will not use bundled media, 
                                SDP usage work in the same way as if BUNLE had not been used.

				When an SDP Answerer receives an SDP Offer, which offers bundled media, and the
				SDP Answerer accepts the offered bundle group. 
                                Any "m=" lines that are rejected have their port set to zero as usual. 
                                Any "m=" lines that are not rejected have the port on the "m=" line, as
                                well as the ICE, 'rtcp' attribute, 'rtcp-mux' and ICE attributes set to 
                                the value to be used by the single 5-tuple over which all the media 
                                in the group will use. 
			</t>
			<t>
				If the SDP Answerer does not accept the "BUNDLE" group in the SDP Offer, it MUST NOT
				include a session level 'group' attribute, with a "BUNDLE" or "USE-BUNDLE" value, in 
				the associated SDP Answer. In addition, the SDP Answerer MUST provide separate 
				port number values for each "m=" line of the SDP Answer and separate ICE atribute values.

	<section anchor="sec-rtp" title="Single vs Multiple RTP Sessions" toc="default">
		<section title="General" toc="default">
			<t>
				When entities negotiate the usage of bundled media, the default assumption 
				is that all media associated with the bundled media will form a single RTP 
				session.
			</t>
			<t>
				The usage of multiple RTP Sessions within a "BUNDLE" group is outside the scope
				of this specification. Other specification needs to extend the mechanism in
				order to allow negotiation of such bundle groups.
			</t>
		</section>
		<section title="Single RTP Session" toc="default">
			<t>
				When a single RTP Session is used, media associated with all "m=" lines part 
				of a bundle group share a single SSRC <xref format="default" pageno="false" 
				target="RFC3550"/> numbering space.
			</t>			
			<t>
				In addition, the following rules and restrictions apply for a single RTP
				Session:
			</t>
			<t>
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>- The dynamic payload type values used in the "m=" lines MUST NOT overlap.</t>
					<t>- The "proto" value in each "m=" line MUST be identical (e.g. RTP/AVPF).</t>
					<t>- A given SSRC SHOULD NOT transmit RTP packets using payload types that 
					originates from different "m=" lines.</t>
				</list>				
			</t>		
			<t>
				NOTE: The last bullet above is to avoid sending multiple media types from the same SSRC. 
				If transmission of multiple media types are done with time overlap RTP and RTCP fails 
				to function. Even if done in proper sequence this causes RTP Timestamp rate switching 
				issues [ref to draft-ietf-avtext-multiple-clock-rates].

			<t>
				When an ICE-enabled SDP Offerer sends an initial SDP offer, it MUST include ICE candidates 
				for each "m=" line associated with a "BUNDLE" group. The candidate values MUST be
				different for each "m=" line associated with the group. This rule does not apply 
                                to subsequent SDP Offers, when the usage of bundled media has already been 
				negotiated.
			</t>
			<t>
				When an ICE-enabled SDP Answerer receives an SDP Offer, offering a "BUNDLE" group and 
				ICE, if the SDP Answerer enables ICE, it MUST include ICE candidates for each "m=" line of
				the SDP Answer. This also applies for "m=" lines that are part of a "USE-BUNDLE" group, in 
				which case the candidate values MUST be the same for each "m=" line associated with
				the group. This rule applies also to subsequent SDP Answers, when the usage 
				of bundled media has already been negotiated.
			</t>
			<t>
				Once the usage of bundled media has been negotiated, ICE connectivity checks and keep-alives 
				only needs to be performed for the 5-tuple used by the "USE-BUNDLE" group, 
                                instead of for each individual m= line 
				associated with the group.
