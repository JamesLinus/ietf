      <t> There are things vendors will do to make sure that the internet has a
      robust and stable solution to congestion. However, significantly
      decreasing the video quality of their currently shipping products is
      probably not one of the things they will do.  </t>

    <section title="Executive Summary">

      <t>This paper looks at what type of good advice, even when accompanied by
      many fine lunches and dinners, is likely to be ignored by vendors. For
      better or worse, many vendors seem to follow the following principals:
      </t>

      <t>
        <list>

          <t>
            Principal 1 - Tomorrow is Better: 
          </t> 
          <t> 
            Version N+1 of a product MUST NOT <xref target="RFC2119"/> have a
            worse user experience than version N under the same network
            conditions.
          </t>
          <t> </t>

          <t>
            Principal 2 - Yesterday is Past:
          </t> 
          <t>
            If a major vendors products does X, and X turns out to be bad for
            the overall user population but makes that product look better in
            some cases to individual users, then it's OK for products from other
            vendors to also do X.
          </t>
          <t> </t>

          <t>
            Principal 3 - Today is not Tomorrow: 
          </t> 
          <t>
            Version 1.0 of the product does not need to worry about congestion
            control, security, management, and so on.
          </t>
          <t> </t>
          
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>
        So what does this all mean for a video application on the web? There is
        some evidence (see <xref target="data" />) to indicate that existing interactive video products use
        more bandwidth than a single TCP connection would use in the same
        network conditions. This is not a unique situation - many applications
        that run over TCP, such as google maps, iTunes, and Netflix can use more
        bandwidth than a single TCP connection would use in the same network
        conditions. One approach is not to abandon the constraints of TCP but
        instead limit an application to what 4 TCP connections would
        use. Variants of this approach has been widely deployed with results
        that don't appear disastrous. It is also the solutions adopted by <xref
        target="I-D.perkins-avtcore-rtp-circuit-breakers" /> which suggests
        using up to an "order of magnitude" more bandwidth than TCP.
      </t>

      <t>
        The IETF needs to find a path to allow interactive video applications to
        have reasonable congestion control without causing a violation of the
        above principles. On the other hand, it needs to make it clear that it
        would be reasonable for standard network operation procedures to block
        traffic from applications that pushed all the TCP traffic to near zero
        bandwidth. Working groups that are constrained to do video in a way that
        is strictly TCP friendly are likely to have their output ignored by the
        vendors. Just like the vendors have ignored it for interactive
        audio.
      </t>

    <section title="Measurements" anchor="data" >
      <t>
        This section contains measurement results showing interactions between
        RTP and TCP flows for the following clients - Apple Facetime, Google
        Hangout, Cisco Movi and Microsoft Skype. We chose these clients since
        they represent the greatest and the latest VOIP clients used by numerous
        end-users across the globe.
      </t>  
       <t> 
        The idea is to observe and analyze the behavior of RTP bandwidth
        utilization when in competition with other flows, say TCP.
        </t>
        <t>
        The measurements represent some early observations and these results have
        not been carefully verified. We encourage others to duplicate the
        experiment.
      </t>
      <t>
        To perform the measurements, the below test-setup was used. 
      </t>
      <figure>
      <artwork alt="Test Setup"
        src="test-setup.png"><![CDATA[TODO ASCII FIGURE

    </figure>
      <t>
       A special version of the Cisco router with pMod tool is used for
       impairing bandwidth between the networks to which devices under test are
       individually connected.  The device under test (DUT) 1 is physically
       connected to "Network B", whereas, DUT-2 is wirelessly connected to
       Internet through Linksys wireless router. The router itself is connected
       to the wireless router via "Network A" a shown.
      </t>  
      <t>
        Network Link A is bandwidth capped at rates 512 Kbps, 1Mbps, 2Mbps and a delay of 0ms,50ms,
        250ms respectively is inserted for the incoming packets, thus resulting in a varied download rates
        and delayed packets at DUT-1.
      </t>
      <t>
        A 2 way audio and video RTP call with a competing FTP flow was
        instantiated to perform the measurements.
      </t>
    <t>
            In the order of Skpye, Hangout, Facetime and Movi, the below graphs
            capture the interactions between RTP and TCP (FTP-Data) as observed
            from DUT-1.
      
      </t>  
      <t>
      Graphs shown below are read as follows:
      </t>
      <t>
        Red Line      --> TCP Flow
      </t>
      <t>
       Black Line    --> RTP Flow
      </t>
      <t>
       X-axis       --> Time in seconds
      </t>
      <t>
       Y-axis       --> Bits per second
      </t>
