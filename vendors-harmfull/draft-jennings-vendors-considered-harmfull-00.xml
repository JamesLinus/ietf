    <abstract>
      <t> There are things vendors will do to make sure the internet has a
      robust and stable solution to congestion. However, significantly
      decreasing the video quality of their currently shipping products is not
      likely to be one of the things they will do.  </t>

    <section title="Executive Summary">

     <t>This paper looks at what type of fine advice, even when accompanied by
     many fine lunches and dinners, is likely to be ignored by vendors. For
     better or worse, many vendors seem to follow the following principals: </t>

      <t>
        <list>

          <t>
            Principal 1 - Tomorrow is Better:
          </t> <t>
            Version N+1 of a product MUST NOT <xref target="RFC2119"/> have a worse users
            experience than version N under the same network conditions.
          </t>
<t> </t>

          <t>
            Principal 2 - Yesterday can't be changed:
          </t> <t>

             If a major vendors products does X, which is bad for the
            user population overall but makes their product look better to
            individual users, it's OK for products from other vendors to do X.
          </t>
<t> </t>

          <t>
            Principal 3 - Today is not Tomorrow: 
          </t> <t>
          Version 1.0 of the product does not need to worry about
            congestion control, security, management, and so on.
          </t>
<t> </t>

        </list>
      </t>

      <t>
        So what does this all mean for a video application on the web? There is
        some evidence to indicate that existing interactive video products use
        more bandwidth than a single TCP connection would use in the same
        network conditions. This is not a unique situation - many applications
        that run over TCP, such as google maps, iTunes, and netflix can use more
        bandwidth than a single TCP connection would use in the same network
        conditions. One approach is not to abandon the constraints of TCP but
        instead limit an application to what 4 TCP connections would use. This
        approach has been widely deployed with results that don't appear
        disastrous in most cases and is the solutions adopted by <xref
        target="I-D.perkins-avtcore-rtp-circuit-breakers" /> which sugests up to
        an "order of magnitude" more than TCP.
      </t>

      <t>
        The IETF needs to find a path to allow video applications to meet their
        needs without causing a violation of the anti-entropy principle. Working
        groups that are constrained to do video in a way that is strictly TCP
        friendly are likely to have their output ignored by the vendors.
