    <section title="Executive Summary">


      <t>Vendors can be a source of significant issues when it comes to congestion control. The IETF gives them good advice on what to do, yet they often choose to ignore it. This paper looks at what type of fine advice, even when accompanied by many fine lunches and dinners, is likely to be ignored by vendors. For better or worse, many vendors seem to follow the following principals. </t>

<t>
<list>

<t>
Principal 1:

Anti-Entropy: Version N+1 of a product MUST NOT have a worse users expereince than version N under the same network conditions. 
</t>

<t>
Principal 2:

Low Road: If a major vendors products does X, which is bad for the user ovulation overall but makes their product look better to individual users, it's OK for products from other vendors to do X as well as long as I can justify it by pointing out the competitor did it first. 
</t>

<t>
Principal 3:

Manjana: Version 1.0 of the product does not need to worry about congestion control, security, management, and so on.
</t>

</list>
</t>

<t>
So what does this all mean for a video application on the web. There is some
evidence to indicate that existing products may use more bandwidth than a single
TCP connection would use in the same network conditions. This is not a unique
situation - many applications that run over TCP, such as google maps, iTunes,
and netflicks can use more bandwidth than a single TCP connection would use in
the same network conditions. One approach is not to abandon the constraints of
TCP but instead limit an application to what 4 TCP connections would use. This
approach has been widely deployed with results that don't appear disastrous in
most cases.
</t>

<t>
The IETF needs to find a path to allow video applications to meet their needs
without causing a violation of the anti-entropy principle. Working groups that
are constrained to do video in a way that is strictly TCP friendly are likely to
have their output ignored by the vendors.

   In many standards track documents several words are used to signify
   the requirements in the specification.  These words are often
   capitalized.  This document defines these words as they should be
   interpreted in IETF documents.  Authors who follow these guidelines
   should incorporate this phrase near the beginning of their document:

<list>
<t>
      The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL
      NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and
      "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
      RFC 2119.
</t></list></t>
<t>
   Note that the force of these words is modified by the requirement
   level of the document in which they are used.
