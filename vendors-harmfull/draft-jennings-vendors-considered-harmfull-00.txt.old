Abstract

   There are things vendors will do to make sure the internet has a
   robust and stable solution to congestion.  However, significantly
   decreasing the video quality of their currently shipping products is
   not likely to be one of the things they will do.

1.  Executive Summary

   This paper looks at what type of fine advice, even when accompanied
   by many fine lunches and dinners, is likely to be ignored by vendors.
   For better or worse, many vendors seem to follow the following
   principals:

      Principal 1 - Tomorrow is Better:

      Version N+1 of a product MUST NOT [RFC2119] have a worse users
      experience than version N under the same network conditions.



      Principal 2 - Yesterday is Past:

      If a major vendors products does X, and X is bad for the user
      population overall but makes their product look better in some
      cases to individual users, it's OK for products from other vendors
      to do X.



      Principal 3 - Today is not Tomorrow:

      Version 1.0 of the product does not need to worry about congestion
      control, security, management, and so on.



   So what does this all mean for a video application on the web?  There
   is some evidence to indicate that existing interactive video products
   use more bandwidth than a single TCP connection would use in the same
   network conditions.  This is not a unique situation - many
   applications that run over TCP, such as google maps, iTunes, and
   netflix can use more bandwidth than a single TCP connection would use
   in the same network conditions.  One approach is not to abandon the
   constraints of TCP but instead limit an application to what 4 TCP
   connections would use.  This approach has been widely deployed with
   results that don't appear disastrous in most cases and is the
   solutions adopted by [I-D.perkins-avtcore-rtp-circuit-breakers] which
   sugests up to an "order of magnitude" more than TCP.

   The IETF needs to find a path to allow video applications to meet
   their needs without causing a violation of the anti-entropy

   principle.  Working groups that are constrained to do video in a way
   that is strictly TCP friendly are likely to have their output ignored
   by the vendors.
